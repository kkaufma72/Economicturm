## Covid and Income Inequality 

# Theory and Background 
Each year the U.S Census Bureau puts out a Food Security report that details how many Americans faced food insecurity or Very Low Food Security in the U.S. They breakdown the percentages by dierent Household characteristics such as whether that household had children, if it was a single parent home, if it received SNAP benefits, whether individuals in that household were disabled or working part time and more. The report gives a detailed overview of the “category” or “type” of person that experiences food insecurity and Very Low Food Security. This data is useful for informing policy makers in the U.S. They can use this data to see what regions, races, genders, and household types are struggling in the U.S. This information will help them create policies that are more targeted. For example, if single mother households with children are struggling the most then they can maybe increase funding to the Womens and Infants Food Program (WIC). We wanted to use this data in a similar way to how policy makers might use this data. 
We analyzed the household, regional, and individual characteristics of people experiencing either Food in- security or Very Low Food Security. We looked at all these characteristics in order to determine which characteristics influenced food Security and Very Low Food Security rates in the U.S. We used regressions, and other visual representations such as line and bar charts in order to model the relationship between certain characteristics and the food security rates. Our visualizations showed a lot of clear relationships between certain variables and the food security rates in the U.S which helped us inform our policy proposal. 



# Methodology 
Initially, we aggregated and cleaned extensive datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau and USDA, focusing on indicators of food insecurity, demographic variables (including location, race, poverty levels, and family composition), and economic markers. We then applied regression analysis and machine learning models to identify predictors of food insecurity and visualize trends over time. Special attention was given to the periods before, during, and after the Great Recession, as well as the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, to understand the temporal dynamics of food insecurity.
Our regression analysis indicated a robust correlation between economic downturns and spikes in food insecurity rates. Specifically, the Great Recession (2007-2009) period showcased a marked decline in food security, with an almost 10 percent drop within two years.

# Impacts of Covid-19 on the Poor and Working Class

Poor and working-class people in the US endure the most devastating financial impacts of Covid-19 mainly because of how governments operating at different levels fail to institute proper reforms promoting economic justice.  In most instances, the current pandemic allowed governments to maintain a neoliberal agenda holding individuals responsible for not living in poverty (Azmanova, 2020).  According to neoliberalism, governments are only responsible for businesses and not people.  Governments will only intervene if an impending crisis cuts into their bottom line when representatives believe their political and ideological goals support business objectives.  Despite how the public health crisis is also economic, the government favors business interests when market forces determine whether institutions will continue thriving. 


# Policy Recommendations:

Targeted Support for Vulnerable Demographics: Policies should prioritize households with children and those in economically disadvantaged regions, particularly the South.
Enhanced SNAP Benefits: Increase SNAP voucher values per child in low-income families to improve food accessibility.
Comprehensive Economic Policies: Address broader economic vulnerabilities through job creation, support for small businesses, and increased minimum wages to mitigate the root causes of food insecurity.
